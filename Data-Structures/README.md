# Data Structures Collection

This directory contains implementations of various data structures in both Python and C++. Each data structure is implemented in its own file with detailed comments and usage examples.

## Implemented Data Structures

### Linear Data Structures
- [ ] Array
- [ ] Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Queue (Simple, Circular, Priority)
- [ ] Deque

### Tree-based Data Structures
- [ ] Binary Tree
- [ ] Binary Search Tree
- [ ] AVL Tree
- [ ] Red-Black Tree
- [ ] B-Tree
- [ ] Heap (Min, Max)

### Hash-based Data Structures
- [ ] Hash Table
- [ ] Hash Set
- [ ] Hash Map

### Graph Data Structures
- [ ] Graph (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)
- [ ] Directed Graph
- [ ] Weighted Graph

### Other Data Structures
- [ ] Trie
- [ ] Skip List
- [ ] Disjoint Set (Union-Find)

## Implementation Details

Each data structure implementation includes:
- Basic operations (insert, delete, search, etc.)
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Usage examples
- Unit tests
- Documentation

## Usage

To use any of these data structures, simply import the corresponding file in your project. Each implementation comes with detailed documentation and examples.
